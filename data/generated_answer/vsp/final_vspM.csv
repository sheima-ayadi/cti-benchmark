2. Attack Complexity (AC): As no additional information about the complexity of the exploit is provided, we'll assume it as Low (L).
3. Privileges Required (PR): No specific privileges are mentioned in the description, so we'll assume None (N).
4. User Interaction (UI): Since user interaction is not required to exploit this vulnerability, the value is None (N).
5. Scope (S): The scope of impact is not specified in the CVE description, but since it's a software vulnerability, we can assume Unchanged (U) as the default value.
6. Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A): Given that the vulnerability allows for SQL injection, which could potentially lead to unauthorized access, modification, or denial of service of data, we'll assign High (H) for all three metrics (C:H, I:H, A:H).

",CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H," Based on the provided CVE description, let's analyze each CVSS v3.1 Base Score metric:

1. Attack Vector (AV): Since the attack can be initiated remotely, the appropriate value is Network (N).
2. Attack Complexity (AC): As no special conditions or specific knowledge are required to exploit this vulnerability, it's considered Low (L).
3. Privileges Required (PR): The manipulation of the argument funcpara1 leads to a stack-based buffer overflow, which typically requires high privileges. However, since the CVE description does not explicitly state that low privileges are insufficient, we will use High (H) for this metric.
4. User Interaction (UI): No user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability, so the value is None (N).
5. Scope (S): The scope of impact is changed as the vulnerability affects a specific component (httpd) within the product (Tenda i6 1.0.0.9(3857)).
6. Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A): Given that the manipulation of funcpara1 leads to a stack-based buffer overflow, which can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, we will consider all three metrics as High (H).

Now let's summarize each metric's value:

- Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)
- Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)
- Privileges Required (PR): High (H)
- User Interaction (UI): None (N)
- Scope (S): Changed (C)
- Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A): High (H)

",CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N," Based on the provided CVE description, let's analyze each CVSS v3.1 Base Score metric:

1. Attack Vector (AV): The attack can be initiated remotely, so it falls under Network (N).
2. Attack Complexity (AC): Since no special conditions or resources are required beyond what is normally provided to users, it's considered Low (L).
3. Privileges Required (PR): No specific privileges are mentioned in the description, so it's None (N).
4. User Interaction (UI): User interaction is required as the attacker manipulates the argument Firstname/Lastname, so it's Required (R).
5. Scope (S): The scope of impact is not specified in the description, but since it seems to be a web application vulnerability, let's assume Unchanged (U) for now.
6. Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A): Since Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) can lead to information disclosure, modification of web page content, and potentially denial of service if the script is malicious, we can assume High (H) for all three.

Now let's calculate the Base Score:

- Base Score Calculation: (AV * 4) + (AC * 3) + (PR * 2) + (UI * 2) + (S * 1) + (C * 1) + (I * 1) + (A * 1)
- In our case, the calculation is: (N * 4) + (L * 3) + (N * 2) + (R * 2) + (U * 1) + (H * 1) + (H * 1) + (H * 1) = 6 + 3 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 18
- The Base Metrics Vector String is: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

However, it's important to note that the final CVSS score requires additional metrics such as Environmental Score (E), Temporal Score (T), and Collateral Damage Potential (CDP) to be calculated. These metrics are based on factors like the affected product's deployment, the user community, and the potential for the vulnerability to affect other systems or organizations.

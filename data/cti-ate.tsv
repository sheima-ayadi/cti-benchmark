https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0066/	Enterprise	3PARA RAT is a remote access tool (RAT) developed in C++ and associated with the group Putter Panda. It communicates with its command and control (C2) servers via HTTP, with commands encrypted using the DES algorithm in CBC mode. The encryption key is derived from the MD5 hash of the string "HYF54&%9&jkMCXuiS." If the DES decryption fails, 3PARA RAT will attempt to decode the commands using an 8-byte XOR key, also derived from the same string. The tool includes commands to retrieve file metadata, list the current working directory, and modify file attributes, such as creation and modification timestamps.	Extract all MITRE Enterprise attack patterns from the following text and map them to their corresponding MITRE technique IDs. Provide reasoning for each identification. Ensure the final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** 3PARA RAT is a remote access tool (RAT) developed in C++ and associated with the group Putter Panda.

https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1061/	Mobile	AbstractEmu is mobile malware that was first detected in October 2021 on Google Play and other third-party app stores. It was found in 19 Android applications, with at least 7 exploiting known Android vulnerabilities to gain root permissions. While primarily affecting users in the United States, AbstractEmu’s reach extends to victims across 17 countries. The malware can modify system settings to grant itself device administrator privileges, monitor notifications, and communicate with its command and control (C2) server via HTTP. AbstractEmu can also grant itself microphone and camera permissions, access location data, and disable Play Protect. Additionally, it can collect extensive device information, including the manufacturer, model, version, serial number, telephone number, IP address, and SIM information. AbstractEmu can download and install additional malware post-infection, access call logs, intercept SMS messages containing two-factor authentication codes, and obtain a list of installed applications. The malware uses encoded shell scripts and exploit binaries to facilitate the rooting process and can silently gain permissions or install additional malware using rooting exploits. To evade detection, AbstractEmu employs code abstraction and anti-emulation checks.	Extract all MITRE Mobile attack patterns from the following text and map them to their corresponding MITRE technique IDs. Provide reasoning for each identification. Ensure the final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs.

https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0045/	Enterprise	ADVSTORESHELL is a spying backdoor associated with APT28, active from at least 2012 to 2016. It is typically used for long-term espionage on targets identified as valuable after an initial reconnaissance phase. ADVSTORESHELL communicates with its command and control (C2) server via port 80 using the Wininet API, exchanging data through HTTP POST requests. Before exfiltration, the backdoor encrypts data using the 3DES algorithm with a hardcoded key. Persistence is achieved by adding itself to the HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run Registry key. ADVSTORESHELL can create a remote shell and execute specified commands, with command execution output stored in a .dat file in the %TEMP% directory. Its C2 traffic is encrypted and then encoded with Base64. Some variants of ADVSTORESHELL also use 3DES encryption for C2 communications.	Extract all MITRE Enterprise attack patterns from the following text and map them to their corresponding MITRE technique IDs. Provide reasoning for each identification. Ensure the final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** ADVSTORESHELL is a spying backdoor associated with APT28, active from at least 2012 to 2016.

ADVSTORESHELL can create a remote shell and execute specified commands, with command execution output stored in a .dat file in the %TEMP% directory. Its C2 traffic is encrypted and then encoded with Base64. Some variants of ADVSTORESHELL also use 3DES encryption for C2 communications.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism T1134 : Access

https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0440/	Enterprise	Agent Smith is mobile malware that generates financial profit by replacing legitimate apps on infected devices with malicious versions that contain fraudulent ads. By July 2019, Agent Smith had infected approximately 25 million devices, primarily targeting users in India, but also impacting other Asian countries, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Agent Smith can inject fraudulent ad modules into existing applications on a device and exploits known OS vulnerabilities, such as Janus, to replace legitimate apps with malicious versions. The malware is designed to display fraudulent ads to generate revenue. It can also hide its icon from the application launcher and delete update packages of infected apps to prevent them from being updated. The malware can impersonate any popular application on an infected device, with its core component disguising itself as a legitimate Google app. The dropper used to deliver Agent Smith is a weaponized version of a legitimate Feng Shui Bundle. Additionally, the core malware is disguised as a JPG file and encrypted with an XOR cipher.	Extract all MITRE Enterprise attack patterns from the following text and map them to their corresponding MITRE technique IDs. Provide reasoning for each identification. Ensure the final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** Agent Smith is mobile malware that generates financial profit by replacing legitimate apps on infected devices with malicious versions that contain fraudulent ads.

https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0092/	Enterprise	Agent.btz is a worm known for spreading primarily through removable devices like USB drives. It gained notoriety for infecting U.S. military networks in 2008. The worm gathers system information and saves it in an XML file, which is then XOR-encoded for obfuscation. On any connected USB flash drive, Agent.btz creates a file named "thumb.dd" that contains details about the infected system and activity logs. The worm also attempts to download an encrypted binary from a specified domain. To propagate itself, Agent.btz drops a copy of itself onto removable media and creates an autorun.inf file that instructs the system to execute the malware when the device is inserted into another computer. Additionally, Agent.btz collects network-related information, including the IP and MAC addresses of the network adapter, as well as IP addresses for the default gateway, WINS, DHCP, and DNS servers, and saves this data into a log file. The worm also records the victim's username and stores it in a separate file.

https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1095/	Mobile	AhRat is an Android remote access tool (RAT) derived from the open-source AhMyth RAT. It began spreading in August 2022 through an update to the previously benign app "iRecorder – Screen Recorder," which was originally released on the Google Play Store in September 2021. AhRat is capable of communicating with its command and control (C2) server via HTTPS requests. It can record audio using the device’s microphone and register with the BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast to start automatically when the device is powered on. AhRat can search for and exfiltrate files with specific extensions, such as .jpg, .mp4, .html, .docx, and .pdf, as well as enumerate files stored on external storage. Additionally, it can register with the CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE and WIFI_STATE_CHANGED broadcast events to trigger further functionality. The malware can also track the device's location and exfiltrate collected data, including audio recordings and files, to the C2 server.	Extract all MITRE Mobile attack patterns from the following text and map them to their corresponding MITRE technique IDs. Provide reasoning for each identification. Ensure the final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. MITRE Mobile IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** AhRat is an Android remote access tool (RAT) derived from the open-source AhMyth RAT.

https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1025/	Enterprise	Amadey is a Trojan bot that has been active since at least October 2018. It communicates with its command and control (C2) servers via HTTP and uses fast flux DNS to evade detection. Amadey can collect information from compromised hosts and send the data to its C2 servers. To maintain persistence, it overwrites registry keys, changing the Startup folder to the one containing its executable. Amadey is capable of decoding antivirus name strings and searching for folders associated with antivirus software. Additionally, it can download and execute files to further infect the host machine with additional malware. The Trojan employs various Windows API calls, such as GetComputerNameA, GetUserNameA, and CreateProcessA, and obfuscates strings related to antivirus vendors, domains, and files to avoid detection.

https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0525/	Mobile	Android/AdDisplay.Ashas is a variant of adware that has been distributed through several apps on the Google Play Store. It communicates with its command and control (C2) server via HTTP and registers to receive the BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast intent, allowing it to activate upon device startup. The adware generates revenue by automatically displaying ads. To avoid detection, Android/AdDisplay.Ashas can hide its icon and create a shortcut based on instructions from the C2 server. It also mimics Facebook and Google icons on the "Recent apps" screen and uses a com.google.xxx package name to further evade identification. The C2 server address is concealed using base-64 encoding. Additionally, Android/AdDisplay.Ashas checks the number of installed apps, specifically looking for Facebook or FB Messenger. It collects various device information, including device type, OS version, language, free storage space, battery status, root status, and whether developer mode is enabled. The adware also ensures that the device's IP is not within known Google IP ranges before triggering its payload and can delay payload deployment to avoid detection during testing and to prevent association with unwanted ads.	Extract all MITRE Mobile attack patterns from the following text and map them to their corresponding MITRE technique IDs. Provide reasoning for each identification. Ensure the final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs.

It was frequently deployed via weaponized .pps files exploiting CVE-2014-6352. This malware leverages the legitimate AutoIt scripting language, designed for Windows GUI automation, for malicious purposes. The AutoIt backdoor attempts to escalate privileges by bypassing User Account Control (UAC). It downloads a PowerShell script that decodes into a standard shellcode loader and communicates with its command and control (C2) server using base64-encoded responses. Additionally, the backdoor is capable of identifying and targeting documents on the victim's system with specific extensions, including .doc, .pdf, .csv, .ppt, .docx, .pst, .xls, .xlsx, .pptx, and .jpeg.

Additionally, the backdoor is capable of identifying and targeting documents on the victim's system with specific extensions, including .doc, .pdf, .csv, .ppt, .docx, .pst, .xls, .xlsx, .pptx, and .jpeg.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism T1134 : Access Token Manipulation T1531 : Account Access Removal T1087 : Account Discovery

https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1111/	Enterprise	DarkGate, first identified in 2018, has evolved into a versatile tool used in various criminal cyber operations, including initial access, data gathering, credential theft, cryptomining, cryptotheft, and pre-ransomware activities. Written in Delphi and named by its author, DarkGate has seen a significant increase in use since 2022 and is actively being developed as a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) offering. DarkGate employs two distinct User Account Control (UAC) bypass techniques to escalate privileges and utilizes parent PID spoofing as part of its "rootkit-like" features to evade detection by tools like Task Manager or Process Explorer. During execution, the malware elevates accounts it creates to the local administrator group. The command and control (C2) infrastructure of DarkGate includes hard-coded domains designed to mimic legitimate services like Akamai CDN or Amazon Web Services. It also disguises C2 traffic within DNS records associated with legitimate services to evade reputation-based detection. DarkGate is capable of searching for cryptocurrency wallets by scanning application window names for specific strings and uses the FindWindow API function to extract data collected via NirSoft tools from the hosting process's memory. When stored credentials linked to cryptocurrency wallets are identified, DarkGate alerts its C2 server.

https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1106/	Enterprise	NGLite is a backdoor Trojan designed to execute commands received through its command and control (C2) channel. While its capabilities are typical for a backdoor, NGLite stands out for using a novel C2 channel that leverages a decentralized network based on the legitimate NKN (New Kind of Network) protocol for communication between the backdoor and threat actors. NGLite initially beacons to the NKN network via an HTTP POST request over TCP port 30003. It uses an AES-encrypted channel for C2 communication, with one observed instance employing the encryption key "WHATswrongwithUu." NGLite abuses NKN infrastructure to facilitate its C2 communication. It identifies the victim system's MAC and IPv4 addresses to establish a unique victim identifier. Additionally, NGLite executes the "whoami" command to collect system information and transmit it back to the C2 server.	Extract all MITRE Enterprise attack patterns from the following text and map them to their corresponding MITRE technique IDs. Provide reasoning for each identification. Ensure the final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** NGLite is a backdoor Trojan designed to execute commands received through its command and control (C2) channel.

https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1124/	Enterprise	SocGholish is a JavaScript-based loader malware that has been active since at least 2017. It has been used in global attacks across various sectors, primarily gaining initial access through drive-by downloads disguised as software updates. Operated by Mustard Tempest, SocGholish’s access has been sold to groups like Indrik Spider for deploying secondary payloads, including remote access Trojans (RATs) and ransomware. SocGholish is executed as a JavaScript payload and can write the output of the `whoami` command to a local temp file using the naming convention `rad<5-hex-chars>.tmp`. It profiles compromised systems to identify domain trust relationships and is often distributed through compromised websites that present malicious content as browser updates.  The malware can exfiltrate data directly to its command and control (C2) server via HTTP and is capable of downloading additional malware onto infected hosts. SocGholish has been named `AutoUpdater.js` to mimic legitimate update files and is frequently delivered within compressed ZIP archives. It also employs single or double Base64 encoding for references to its second-stage server URLs. Additionally, SocGholish has been spread via emails containing malicious links.

https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1105/	Enterprise	COATHANGER is a remote access tool (RAT) designed to target FortiGate networking appliances. It was first deployed in 2023 in targeted intrusions against military and government entities in the Netherlands and other locations. Disclosed in early 2024, COATHANGER has been attributed with high confidence to a state-sponsored entity in the People's Republic of China. The malware uses an HTTP GET request to establish a follow-on TLS tunnel for command and control (C2) communication. COATHANGER provides a BusyBox reverse shell for C2 operations and creates a daemon for timed check-ins with the C2 infrastructure. It decodes configuration items from a bundled file to facilitate C2 activity and connects to the C2 infrastructure using SSL. The malware is installed after exploiting a vulnerable FortiGate device and surveys the contents of system files during installation. COATHANGER sets the GID of `httpsd` to 90 upon infection, installs itself into a hidden directory, and removes and writes malicious shared objects that replace legitimate system functions such as `read(2)`.	Extract all MITRE Enterprise attack patterns from the following text and map them to their corresponding MITRE technique IDs. Provide reasoning for each identification. Ensure the final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** COATHANGER is a remote access tool (RAT) designed to target FortiGate networking appliances.

https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1101/	Enterprise	LoFiSe has been used by ToddyCat since at least 2023 to identify and collect files of interest on targeted systems. LoFiSe is capable of collecting files into password-protected ZIP archives for exfiltration. It periodically gathers all files from the working directory every three hours, placing them into a password-protected archive for later extraction. The malware also targets specific files of interest on compromised systems, saving them in the `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\` and `C:\Windows\Temp\` folders for further evaluation and exfiltration. LoFiSe monitors the file system to identify files smaller than 6.4 MB with extensions such as .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx, .pdf, .rtf, .tif, .odt, .ods, .odp, .eml, and .msg. It has been executed through DLL side-loading as a file named `DsNcDiag.dll`.	Extract all MITRE Enterprise attack patterns from the following text and map them to their corresponding MITRE technique IDs. Provide reasoning for each identification.

https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1122/	Enterprise	Mispadu is a banking trojan written in Delphi, first observed in 2019, that operates under a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) model. Managed and sold by the Malteiro cybercriminal group, Mispadu primarily targets victims in Brazil and Mexico, with confirmed operations across Latin America and Europe. Mispadu establishes persistence by creating a link in the startup folder and adding an entry to the registry key `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`. It utilizes malicious Google Chrome extensions to steal financial data and monitors browser activity for online banking actions, often displaying full-screen overlays to block user access to legitimate sites or to prompt for additional data. The trojan can capture and replace Bitcoin wallet addresses in the clipboard on compromised hosts. Mispadu’s dropper uses VBS files to install and execute its payloads. Additionally, the malware steals credentials from mail clients using NirSoft MailPassView and from Google Chrome. Before execution, Mispadu decrypts its encrypted configuration files. Mispadu includes a copy of the OpenSSL library to encrypt its command and control (C2) traffic, and it sends collected financial data to its C2 server.

These checks are performed through native Windows functions such as GetFileAttributesW. Akira will delete system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands. Akira executes native Windows functions such as GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo. Akira can identify remote file shares for encryption. Akira verifies the deletion of volume shadow copies by checking for the existence of the process ID related to the process created to delete these items. Akira uses the GetSystemInfo Windows function to determine the number of processors on a victim machine. Akira will leverage COM objects accessed through WMI during execution to evade detection.

https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1104/	Enterprise	SLOWPULSE is a malware that was used by APT5 as early as 2020 including against U.S. Defense Industrial Base (DIB) companies. SLOWPULSE has several variants and can modify legitimate Pulse Secure VPN files in order to log credentials and bypass single and two-factor authentication flows. SLOWPULSE is applied in compromised environments through modifications to legitimate Pulse Secure files. SLOWPULSE can write logged ACE credentials to /home/perl/PAUS.pm in append mode, using the format string %s:%s\n. SLOWPULSE can modify LDAP and two factor authentication flows by inspecting login credentials and forcing successful authentication if the provided password matches a chosen backdoor password. SLOWPULSE can insert malicious logic to bypass RADIUS and ACE two factor authentication (2FA) flows if a designated attacker-supplied password is provided. SLOWPULSE can log credentials on compromised Pulse Secure VPNs during the DSAuth::AceAuthServer::checkUsernamePasswordACE-2FA authentication procedure. SLOWPULSE can hide malicious code in the padding regions between legitimate functions in the Pulse Secure libdsplibs.so file.	Extract all MITRE Enterprise attack patterns from the following text and map them to their corresponding MITRE technique IDs. Provide reasoning for each identification. Ensure the final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** SLOWPULSE is a malware that was used by APT5 as early as 2020 including against U.S. Defense Industrial Base (DIB) companies.

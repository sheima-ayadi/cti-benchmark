https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26909,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  soc: qcom: pmic_glink_altmode: fix drm bridge use-after-free  A recent DRM series purporting to simplify support for ""transparent bridges"" and handling of probe deferrals ironically exposed a use-after-free issue on pmic_glink_altmode probe deferral.  This has manifested itself as the display subsystem occasionally failing to initialise and NULL-pointer dereferences during boot of machines like the Lenovo ThinkPad X13s.  Specifically, the dp-hpd bridge is currently registered before all resources have been acquired which means that it can also be deregistered on probe deferrals.

When the display controller is later initialised, this triggers a use-after-free when attaching the bridges:   dp -> aux -> dp-hpd (freed)  which may, for example, result in the freed bridge failing to attach:   [drm:drm_bridge_attach [drm]] *ERROR* failed to attach bridge /soc@0/phy@88eb000 to encoder TMDS-31: -16  or a NULL-pointer dereference:   Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000  ...

[DB: slightly fixed commit message by adding the word 'commit'] ",CWE-416,"Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-416 (Use After Free). 

Justification: The vulnerability is caused by a use-after-free issue in the Linux kernel's DRM bridge implementation. Specifically, the dp-hpd bridge is deregistered before all resources have been acquired, leaving a window of opportunity for other drivers to store pointers to the bridge that will be deallocated soon. When the display controller is later initialized, this triggers a use-after-free error when attaching the bridges. This matches the definition of CWE-416, which involves accessing or manipulating memory after it has been freed.
